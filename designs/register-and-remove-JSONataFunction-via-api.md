# Register and Remove JSONata fucntions via API

## Summary

Adding an API so that additional JSONata functions could be added would make good extension point. 

## Authors

 - @dustinw (node-red forum) / @dwindibank (github)

## Details

This section provides the detailed information for the proposal. This template
does not provide a structure for this section, but it should address:

 1. any public APIs it introduces
 2. the user experience of the feature - what it does and how it is used
 3. any migration concerns
 4. mock-up UI designs

The discussion on the initial PR will provide guidance on what further material
is needed.
